Generate bash completion script for this application.

To use the completion script, you need to have the package
"bash-completion" installed.

Then you may load completions in the current session:

    source <(ðŸ–– ðŸ‘€ bash)

To load the completion script for all your new bash sessions,
either (for easy updates) add the above line to your bash profile
(e.g. ~/.bash_profile) or (for more security) write the output of
the command `ðŸ–– ðŸ‘€ bash` to a file inside the bash-completion search
dir (usually the "/etc/bash_completion.d").
