Generate zsh completion script for this application.

To use the completion script, you must have zsh completion
enabled, you can do it by adding the following line to your
zsh init script (e.g. ~/.zshrc) and restart the shell:

    autoload -U compinit; compinit

Now you may load completions in the current session:

    source <(ðŸ–– ðŸ‘€ zsh)

To load the completion script for all your new zsh sessions,
either (for easy updates) add the above line to your zsh init
script, or (for more security) write the output of the command
`ðŸ–– ðŸ‘€ zsh` to a file inside one of dirs listed by `echo $fpath`.
